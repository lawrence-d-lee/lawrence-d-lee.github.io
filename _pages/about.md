I am a Posdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Manchester, where I am working with [Dr Tom Kempton](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/thomas.kempton/).

My research focuses on fractal geometry, but I'm also interested in dynamical systems and number theory (particularly Diophantine approximation).

Prior to Manchester I was an EPSRC funded PhD student at the University of St Andrews, where I was supervised by [Regius Professor Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/) and [Professor Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/).

My Erdös number is 2 (Lee → Vaughan → Erdös).
